# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
**Overview**
This project demonstrates how to use linear regression for predictive modeling. The objective is to predict a target variable based on one or more predictor variables using historical data. This project can be applied to various domains such as finance, healthcare, and marketing.

**Features**
* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Linear regression model training and evaluation
* Visualization of data and model performance
* Easy-to-follow code and documentation

**Usage**
* Data Preparation
Place your dataset in the data directory. Ensure your dataset is in CSV format with appropriate headers.

**Results**
The results, including model coefficients, performance metrics, and visualizations, will be saved in the results directory.
